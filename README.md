Lidar sends laser beam and using the time it takes to emit and receive the signal, the distance to an obstacle is measured. In this project Lidar segmentation, clustering, downsampling and filtering are performed on real time point cloud data. The result can be observed in the figure below for real time streaming of point cloud data.

## Classroom Workspace

The workspace provided in the SFND classroom comes preinstallated with everything that you need to finish the exercises and projects. Versions used by Udacity for this ND are as follows:

* Ubuntu 16.04
* PCL - v1.7.2
* C++ v11
* gcc v5.5

**Note** The [[CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt)] file provided in this repo can be used locally if you have the same package versions as mentioned above. If you want to run this project locally (outside the Udacity workspace), please follow the steps under the **Local Installation** section.


## Local Installation

### Ubuntu 

1. Clone this github repo:

   ```sh
   cd ~
   git clone https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection.git
   ```

2.  Edit [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/udacity/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) as follows:

   ```cmake
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8 FATAL_ERROR)
   
   add_definitions(-std=c++14)
   
   set(CXX_FLAGS "-Wall")
   set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS, "${CXX_FLAGS}")
   
   project(playback)
   
   find_package(PCL 1.11 REQUIRED)
   
   include_directories(${PCL_INCLUDE_DIRS})
   link_directories(${PCL_LIBRARY_DIRS})
   add_definitions(${PCL_DEFINITIONS})
   list(REMOVE_ITEM PCL_LIBRARIES "vtkproj4")
   
   
   add_executable (environment src/environment.cpp src/render/render.cpp src/processPointClouds.cpp)
   target_link_libraries (environment ${PCL_LIBRARIES})
   ```

3. Execute the following commands in a terminal

   ```shell
   sudo apt install libpcl-dev
   cd ~/SFND_Lidar_Obstacle_Detection
   mkdir build && cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ./environment
   ```

   This should install the latest version of PCL. You should be able to do all the classroom exercises and project with this setup.
   
**Note** The library version of PCL being distributed by the apt repository for 18.04 and 20.04 are both older than v1.11. The following links have the information regarding the versions-

[Bionic 18.04](https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/core/bionic/universe/updates/libpcl-dev)
[Focal 20.04](https://www.ubuntuupdates.org/package/core/focal/universe/base/libpcl-dev)

You can either build PCL from source (for v1.11) or use the older version.
